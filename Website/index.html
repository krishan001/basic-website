                <h3>Why should you work out?</h3>
                <p>Exercise benefits every part of the body, including the mind. Exercising causes the body to make chemicals
                    that can help a person to feel good. Exercise can help people sleep better. It can also help some people
                    who have mild depression and low self-esteem. Plus, exercise can give people a real sense of accomplishment
                    and pride at having achieved a certain goal â€” like beating an old time in the 100-meter dash. Exercise
                    can help you look better. People who exercise burn more calories and look more toned than those who don't.
                    In fact, exercise can help keep your body at a healthy weight. Exercise helps people lose weight and
                    lower the risk of some diseases. Exercising regularly decreases a person's risk of developing certain
                    diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure. </p>

                <h3>How often should you work out?</h3>
                <p>As you can imagine, there's no simple formula that's right for everyone. (Come on, you didn't really think
                    it'd be that easy, did you?) If you're looking to amp up your fitness level, your magic number of days
                    depends on how active you already are. For example, you'll probably see results from one day a week if
                    you don't already work out at all, he says. But if you're used to multiple workout days a week, one day
                    probably won't challenge your body enough to stay at peak form or make progress. The breakdown varies
                    depending on your specific goals, but in general, four to five days a week will do the trick if you're
                    aiming to improve your fitness and stay in shape.</p>
