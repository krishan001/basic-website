                <h3>What are macros?</h3>
                <p> The word "macro" is short for macronutrients. These are the food groups that are required largely in the
                    diet. The three macros are: Protein, Fat and Carbohydrates. How many calories someone consumes per day
                    depends on their macronutrient intake. Protein and carbohydrates have 4 calories per gram whereas fat,
                    which is more energy dense, has 9 calories per gram.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="box">

                <h3>Calculating Protein</h3>
                <p>In general when deciding how much protein you should have a good basis is 1g of protein for every 1lbs of
                    bodyweight</p>

            </div>
            <div class="box">

                <h3>Calculating Fat</h3>
                <p>To calculate the amount of fat you should be eating is another simple formula. Simply multiply your bodyweight
                    in lbs by 0.3 and that is the amount of fat you should be eating per day.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="box">

                <h3>Calculating Carbs</h3>
                <p>To calculate Carbs is a bit more complicated. You must assign the remaining calories from your day to them.
                    Carbs and protein both have roughly 4 calories per gram and fat has roughly 9 grams per gram.
                    So to figure out your carbs you must:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Multiply your protein target by 4</li>
                        <li>Multiply your fat target by 9</li>
                        <li>Add these together and subtract the sum from your total calories, giving you the number of calories you have remaining for carbs</li>
                        <li>Divide this by 4 to get the number of grams of carbs you should eat every day</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
