                <h2>Deadlift</h2>
                <img src="./img/how-to-deadlift.jpg" alt="How to deadlift">
                <p> Walk to the bar. Stand with your mid-foot under the bar. Your shins shouldn’t touch it yet. Put your heels
                    hip-width apart, narrower than on Squats. Point your toes out 15°. Grab the bar. Bend over without bending
                    your legs. Grip the bar narrow, about shoulder-width apart like on the Overhead Press. Your arms must
                    be vertical when looking from the front. Bend your knees. Drop into position by bending your knees until
                    your shins touch the bar. Do NOT let the bar move away from your mid-foot. If it moves, start from scratch
                    with step one. Lift your chest. Straighten your back by raising you chest. Do not change your position
                    – keep the bar over your mid-foot, your shins against the bar, and your hips where they are. Pull. Take
                    a big breath, hold it and stand up with the weight. Keep the bar in contact with your legs while you
                    pull. Don’t shrug or lean back at the top. Lock your hips and knees.

                <h2>Bench Press</h2>
                <img src="./img/how-to-bench-press.jpg" alt="How to Bench">
                <p>Setup. Lie on the flat bench with your eyes under the bar. Lift your chest and squeeze your shoulder-blades.
                    Feet flat on the floor. Grab the bar. Put your pinky on the ring marks of your bar. Hold the bar in the
                    base of your palm with a full grip and straight wrists. Unrack. Take a big breath and unrack the bar
                    by straightening your arms. Move the bar over your shoulders with your elbows locked. Lower the bar.
                    Lower it to your mid-chest while tucking your elbows 75°. Keep your forearms vertical. Hold your breath
                    at the bottom. Press. Press the bar from your mid-chest to above your shoulders. Keep your butt on the
                    bench. Lock your elbows at the top. Breathe.

                <h2>Squat</h2>
                <img src="./img/How-to-squat.jpg" alt="How to Squat">
                <p>Setup. Face the bar. Grab it tight with a medium grip. Put it on your upper-back by dipping under the bar.
                    Raise your chest. Unrack. Move your feet under the bar. Unrack it by straightening your legs. Step back
                    with straight legs. Lock your hips and knees. Squat. Take a big breath, hold it and Squat down. Push
                    your knees out while moving your hips back. Keep your lower back neutral. Break Parallel. Squat down
                    until your hips are below your knees. Thighs parallel to the floor isn’t low enough. You must break parallel.
                    Squat Up. Break parallel then Squat back up. Keep your knees out and chest up. Lock your hips and knees
                    at the top. Breathe.
